<div><p>Panama City Beach is well-known for its turquoise waters, white sand beaches and abundance of wildlife. The city offers unique experiences that you won't find anywhere else. One of Panama City Beach's most popular tourist spots is Gulf World Marine Park, which attracts around 150,000 visitors annually.</p><p>There are many outdoor activities, including swimming, kayaking, snorkeling, and golf. The best thing to do in Destin is to drive to Gulf World to swim with the dolphins.</p><p>Provisioned dolphins have to be bribed for fish so they can interact with humans. They don't seem interested in humans because they are given food. They have been reported as friendly and curious by visitors. Aggression continues to be a problem.</p> <b>Shells</b></div>
