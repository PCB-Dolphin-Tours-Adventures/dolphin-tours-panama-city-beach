Here they are able to eat tuna or even dolphins in its deep waters.</p><p>While sea water can be effective in disinfecting, contact with wild dolphins could result in disease transmission. These risks could pose serious dangers to both dolphins as well as humans. You don't want a fine for swimming with dolphins.</p><p>While dolphins might seem curious, some of their behaviors can be misinterpreted to mean they are friendly. Avoid engaging, following, or any other interaction with dolphins when they approach you in water. Instead, take immediate steps to get away.</p></div>
