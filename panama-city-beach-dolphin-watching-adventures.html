<div><p>Mid-morning is the best time of day to spot dolphins.</p><p>The season for sea turtles can last from April through November in Destin. It's much more common to see these magnificent creatures in July and august. Destin's famous East Pass was Man-Made. They dug a path that ran from Choctawhatchee Bay up to the Gulf of Mexico. Evidently, they were right. The flood waters rose and were rushed through the excavations, creating the East Pass.</p><p>Do not touch dolphins. <b>Snorkeling</b>  If the dolphins would like to touch you, they'll do it. You can touch only one dolphin at a time, and all other dolphins will flee the area. <i>Shells</i>  This can negatively impact dolphin behavior and cause irritation among other people in your group.</p></div>

<div> <p>It is possible to have seen dolphins in captivity at a marine park. However, it is more exciting to watch them in their natural habitat. Although wild dolphin behavior is unpredictable and not possible to predict, the tour captains have many years of experience operating on the waters around St. Andrew Bay almost every single day. Our captains have extensive knowledge of the areas where dolphins are most common and do everything they can to ensure that guests have an unforgettable experience. You may see dolphins jumping, searching for food and communicating among themselves on many tours.</p><p>"We had a great day! Captain Dave was an amazing captain. He made sure we were taken to a spot that dolphins are frequent. Lucky us, we were able to swim with them, snorkel with them, and get to know them. It was a wonderful adventure that I will forever remember. I would recommend Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC.</p><p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin watching adventures - Milestone</h2><ol><li>Milestone</li><li>Calm</li><li>Moonlight</li><li>Appreciation</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Snorkeling</li><li>Deck</li><li>Adventure</li><li>Quest</li><li>Bay</li><li>Temperature</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Thrill</li><li>Quay</li></ol> The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p></div>
