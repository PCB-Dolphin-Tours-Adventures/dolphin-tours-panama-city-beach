<div> <p>It is possible to have seen dolphins in captivity at a marine park. However, it is more exciting to watch them in their natural habitat.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin discovery tours - Temperature</h2><ul><li>Deck</li><li>Adventure</li><li>Quest</li><li>Bay</li><li>Temperature</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Thrill</li><li>Quay</li><li>Family</li><li>Harbor</li><li>Learning</li><li>Hospitality</li><li>Forecast</li></ul> Although wild dolphin behavior is unpredictable and not possible to predict, the tour captains have many years of experience operating on the waters around St. Andrew Bay almost every single day. Our captains have extensive knowledge of the areas where dolphins are most common and do everything they can to ensure that guests have an unforgettable experience. You may see dolphins jumping, searching for food and communicating among themselves on many tours.</p><p>"We had a great day! Captain Dave was an amazing captain. He made sure we were taken to a spot that dolphins are frequent. Lucky us, we were able to swim with them, snorkel with them, and get to know them. It was a wonderful adventure that I will forever remember. <i>Feedback</i>  I would recommend Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC.</p><p>Dolphins are able to breathe through their blowhole located on the top portion of their head. The interesting thing about dolphins is that they can still experience respiratory irritation. It could result in the equivalent to someone coughing or sneezing. The dolphins' coughing experience is called "chuffing".</p></div>
